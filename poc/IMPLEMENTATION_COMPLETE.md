## üéØ System Capabilities

### Political Analysis
```python
# Generate 1000 census-proportional personas
personas = generator.generate_representative_population(1000)

# Test policy support with demographic breakdowns
result = await political_analyzer.test_policy_support(
    policy_description="Universal healthcare system",
    policy_topic="healthcare", 
    personas=personas
)

# Output: 67% support, strongest among Hispanic college-educated women (78%)
```

### Market Research
```python
# Test product at multiple price points
result = await market_researcher.test_product_reception(
    product_name="Smart Home Assistant",
    price_points=[99, 149, 199, 249],
    personas=target_market_personas
)

# Output: Optimal price $149, 34% purchase intent, $2.1M revenue projection
```

### Validation & Accuracy
```python
# Validate against historical polling data
validation_results = await validator.run_comprehensive_validation(
    personas=test_personas,
    max_targets=20
)

# Output: 85% average accuracy across 20 validation targets
```
